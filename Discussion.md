**Discussion Question - Lab1-Part 2**
It would be easier if the programmer knew for sure that whenever fizzbuzz would run it would be with 17.
This would remove the need for a try and catch block.
Additionally, in the for loop instead of using a variable for the number of cycles the loop would make, one would be able to just use the number 17.
