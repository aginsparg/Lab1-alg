**Discussion Question - Lab1-Part 2**
It would be easier if the programmer knew for sure that whenever fizzbuzz would run it would be with 17.
This would remove the need for a try and catch block.
Additionally, in the for loop instead of using a variable for the number of cycles the loop would make, one would be able to just use the number 17.

I think that by just changing the arguments of the main method and running the program from Main,
the user could see if the outcome of the program matches with what should be happening.
Obviously, this would not be practical in a program with many methods as one would not
know exactly where an error is. However, in a small, one method program, just 
running the program can check if the method is working properly.
